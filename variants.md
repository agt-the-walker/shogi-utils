I like Shogi, but I also like other abstracts such as Arimaa, Chess and
especially [Capablanca Random Chess](http://brainking.com/en/GameRules?tp=75),
since I hate studying openings. For this reason, I'd like to try
[Shogi22680](README.md), but I'm also interested in
[other board sizes and pieces](cheatsheet.md).

IMHO, a good Shogi variant:

1. shouldn't be more drawish than Chess
2. shouldn't give the first player an advantage greater than in Chess
3. shouldn't last more than twice as long as the average Chess game (in plies)
4. shouldn't require studying opening theory (principles are fine though)
5. shouldn't be more difficult to learn than
   [Wa Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa_shogi)

Any reasonable Shogi variant with drops shouldn't be near as drawish as Chess.
I propose to use the [Pie rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_rule) to
address the second point, since randomizing the starting position (third point)
will probably give the first player a greater than usual advantage in some
cases. For the rest, [Chu Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_shogi) (and
larger board variants) probably takes too long and is also too difficult to
learn.
